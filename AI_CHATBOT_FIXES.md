# AI Chatbot Fixes Applied

## üîß Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: AI Chatbot Using Hardcoded Responses ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The general repository analysis was using pre-written template responses instead of calling the Gemini AI API.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated `lib/ai/actions/handleGeneralResponse.ts` to actually call the Gemini AI API
- The AI now provides genuine, dynamic analysis based on your repository data
- Respects the "Critic Mode" toggle for different analysis tones
- Shows proper "AI is thinking..." loading state

**What Changed**:
- Removed all hardcoded template responses
- Added real Gemini API integration with detailed prompts
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages

### Issue 2: Job Template Feature Failing ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The job recommendation feature was failing to return the 4 most relevant repositories due to unreliable AI response parsing.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `lib/ai/actions/recommendReposForJob.ts` with robust JSON parsing
- Added fallback parsing methods if JSON fails
- Improved error handling and graceful degradation
- Better type safety with TypeScript

**What Changed**:
- More reliable JSON array parsing from AI responses
- Multiple fallback strategies if parsing fails
- Better error messages for debugging
- Fallback to top-starred repos if AI can't make good matches

## üöÄ Next Steps for Full Functionality

### 1. Verify Vercel Environment Variables
The most common cause of AI feature failures is missing or incorrect environment variables on Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Ensure you have: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. **CRITICAL**: The variable name must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` (client-side access)
5. Verify the API key is correct (no typos, extra spaces, or quotes)
6. After adding/updating, **redeploy** your project for changes to take effect

### 2. Test the Fixes
Try these prompts to test the improved AI:

**General Analysis**:
- "What do you think about my repos?"
- "Analyze my repository structure"
- Toggle "Critic Mode" and try again

**Job Recommendations**:
- "Recommend repos for a frontend developer job"
- "Show me the best projects for a full-stack engineer position"

### 3. Monitor for Issues
If problems persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify your Gemini API key has sufficient quota
3. Ensure your repositories are loaded before asking for analysis

## üîç Technical Details

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# In .env.local and Vercel
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here

# Optional configuration (already set)
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
GEMINI_TOP_P=0.8
GEMINI_TOP_K=40
GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS=8192
```

### Files Modified
1. `lib/ai/actions/handleGeneralResponse.ts` - Complete rewrite for real AI integration
2. `lib/ai/actions/recommendReposForJob.ts` - Improved parsing and error handling

The AI chatbot should now provide genuine, intelligent responses instead of template-based replies!
