### 2. **Portfolio Templates** 
- Job-specific repository organization

- One-click professional portfolio generation

### 3. **Features GitHub Doesn't Have**
- Bulk operations (delete, archive, organize)

Title: "Built a tool for bulk GitHub operations because I was tired of clicking delete 50 times"

Hey r/programming,

I got frustrated deleting old repos one by one on GitHub, so I built NeatRepo over the weekend.

Features:
- Bulk delete/archive repositories
- Portfolio templates for job applications
- Better organization than GitHub's interface
- Built with Next.js + Supabase

[Demo video/screenshots]

It's free and I'm looking for feedback. What other GitHub features are you missing?

Would love your thoughts and bug reports!

**Remember**: The goal is to make developers think "Holy shit, I need this!" within the first 5 seconds. Lead with the pain, deliver the solution, and make them feel stupid for not having it already. 🚀

**Pro Tip**: Record multiple versions of the same demo with different hooks/narratives. A/B test which performs better on each platform. The controversial Twitter version might flop on LinkedIn, but kill on Twitter. 📊
